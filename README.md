### ***Description***

A simple browser-based game of single-player baccarat. 

#### ***What is baccarat?*** 

Baccarat is a card game similar to blackjack, in that two cards are dealt to a player and a banker, and the closest score to a specific number is declared the winner. Of course, the methods and specific target are wildly different in baccarat and blackjack: Baccarat counts cards as the last digit of the sum of the two cards in a hand, with only a two- or three-card hand possible needing to add up to 9, whereas blackjack can have a much larger hand of cards that need to approach a true sum of 21 to win, so long that it is not greater than that number else that hand automatically loses. 

In the game of baccarat, face cards—that is, the jack, queen, and king—are evaluated the same as 0, with aces low (1) and the 2 through 9 cards expressing their face value!

The sum of both cards in a hand has to be closest to the number 9 to win the game!

#### ***How do you play baccarat?***

For each game, the player must bet on three options—you can bet on multiple options at once—the player hand winning, the banker hand winning, or both hands tying. The player gets a 1:1 payout for player or banker winning, but a tie pays out 8:1 or 9:1 (for each dollar wagered, you win 8 or 9 dollars in return)! 

The dealer places two cards from a shuffled deck in two piles: the player side and the dealer side. Based on the last digit of the sum of the two cards, either the player or dealer recieves an additional card, with the opposite hand either staying or recieving their own card as well based on which number they began with or the other player recieves through the third card. Trust me, it can get much more complicated...

Don't forget, however—to play baccarat is a game of chance, with neither hand having a natural advantage!

So, please have fun and enjoy baccarat!

For this project, only one player will be possible, with a future version possibly supporting manifold players.

Shuffling cards sound I WILL use for the shuffling animation comes from [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/people/SomeoneCool15/sounds/423767/)

I already know I'll be using the Fisher-Yates algorithm, so I found a [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59810241/how-to-fisher-yates-shuffle-a-javascript-array) to help with that.
